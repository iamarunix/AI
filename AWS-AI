AI -> ML -> Deep LEarning -> GenAI
AI Components
 Data Layer -> ML framework and Algorithms Layer -> Model Layer -> Application Layer 
 ML : Its a type of AI for buildiing methods that allows machines to LEarning
 DL: uses neurons and synapses(like our brain) to train a Model 
 Multi-Modal Models: Does NOT  rely on single type of input. Does NOT provide single type of output. Provides output in mix of audio video and text

 ML Terms:

GPT (Generative pre-trained Transformer) - Generate human text or computer code based ion input prompts 
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) - similar intent to GPT, but reads the text in two directions 
RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) - meant for sequential data such as time-series or text useful in speech recognition, time-series prediction 
ResNET (Residual Network) - Deep convolutional Neural Network used for image recognition tasks, object detection, facial recogition
SVM - Support Vector Machine - ML algorithm for classification and regression
Wavenet - model to generate raw audio waveform, used in Speech Synthesis 
 GAN-Generative Adversarial Network - models used to generate synthetic data such as images, videos or sounds that resemble the training data. Helpful for data augmentation
 XGBoost Extreme Gradient Boosting - an implementation of gradient boosting  

 pseudo labeling 
  labled nad unlabeled data
  structured(model is trained ro map inputs to known outputs) eg DB tables 
  unstructed data - data from social networks 

  ML algorithm
   supervised learning -   mapping function can predict a output for unseen input . It labeled data 
   supervised 
   discrete - separate separate data 
   training set/validation set/test set data 
   self supervised leaning 

   MAE  MAPE RMSE R2 used torvalute mfoels tht predicts  a continous value
